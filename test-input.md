# New Feature: User Profile Dashboard

## Overview
We need to build a new user profile dashboard that allows users to view and edit their personal information, preferences, and activity history.

## Background
Currently, users can only view basic profile information. We've received feedback that users want more control over their profiles and easier access to their activity.

## Proposed Solution
Create a comprehensive dashboard with the following sections:
- Personal Information (name, email, avatar)
- Account Settings (password, 2FA, notifications)
- Activity History (recent logins, actions)
- Privacy Controls (who can see what)

## User Benefits
- Better control over personal data
- Easier account management
- Improved privacy settings
- View activity for security awareness

## Technical Considerations
- Must integrate with existing auth system
- Need to maintain GDPR compliance
- Should work on mobile and desktop
- Real-time updates for activity feed

## Success Criteria
- 80% of users find new dashboard within first week
- Profile update completion rate increases by 40%
- Support tickets about profile issues decrease by 50%
